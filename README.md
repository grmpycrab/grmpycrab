**Simple Human (Programmer, Producer, Musician)**

I'm a IT student at Davao Oriantal State University currently in my sophomore year (2023 - 2024). One of my biggest dreams is to become one of the most succesful programmers in the world. I am a music producer also so yeah, I make music. Currently, I am 20 years old and as you can see in my name, I am a cancer coz I was born in June 27, 2003. I have a YouTube channel so maybe if you're interested, you can listen to my music there.
